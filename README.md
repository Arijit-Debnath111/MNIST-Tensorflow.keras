# MNIST-Tensorflow.keras
It involves the MNIST datasets from the tensorflow.keras datasetswhich is an inbuilt dataset given by Yann LeCun .
MNIST is especially handwritten digit dataset given by Yann LeCun.
I have build a model in Neural Network to formulate the output of the datasets or to recognize the digit from the MNIST datasets.
