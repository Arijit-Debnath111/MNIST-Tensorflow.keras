# MNIST-Tensorflow.keras
It involves the MNIST datasets from the tensorflow.keras datasetswhich is an inbuilt dataset given by Yann LeCun .
MNIST is especially handwritten digit dataset given by Yann LeCun.
I have build a model in Neural Network to formulate the output of the datasets or to recognize the digit from the MNIST datasets.
For this hands on I performed-
                             1> Model Building
                             2> Model Definition
                             3> Model Compilation
                             4> Model Training
The output and predictions are evaluated from the models.
